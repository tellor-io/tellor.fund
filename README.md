# Tellor Funding Proposals

Welcome to tellor.fund

Tellor.fund is an interface and smart contract to crowd fund community proposed endeavors, initiatives, and activities.  Users come to this interface and contribute TRB to proposals on the list. 

The Tellor team will post community proposed items to the tellor.fund with details describing what it is, how much it costs, deadline, and a % tracking how much each item has been funded. 

## How it works

1. Community members reach out to the Tellor team about something they’d like to propose.
2. Tellor team decides if it’s appropriate and if it fits with our mission.
3. If yes, then we’ll add it to the proposals list with a deadline.
4. Once on the list, any TRB holders can contribute funds to it.
5. If an item reaches 100% funding then the TRB is released to Tellor to pay for that proposed activity.
6. If the time frame ends before 100% funding then the TRB is returned to the contributors.

To interact with tellor.fund you’ll need a metamask wallet with TRB in it.  Once you navigate to http://www.tellor.fund you’ll see a list of proposed items labeled with an ID number, title, and additional information.    In order to fund a specific proposal, scroll through the list and note the ID number associated with your desired selection.  Beneath the list you’ll see the *fund* button and accompanying input box.  Type in ID number and the amount of TRB you’d like to contribute and click *fund*.  This will trigger 2 transactions on metamask, one allow your metamask to spend TRB on your behalf, and the other to actually send the funds to the smart contract.  

Once you’ve contributed funds to an item you’ll see a record of it appear in the lower box that holds the list of all proposals you’ve contributed to and other relevant details.  You should also notice in the proposals box that the % funded will have increased on the proposal you contributed to.

## *Disclaimer*
*The TRB of the successfully funded proposals, upon reaching 100% will be sent to the Tellor teams multi-sig wallet.  This way we can be in control of dispersing the funds to the proper and intended recipient.*
